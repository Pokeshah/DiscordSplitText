# DiscordSplitText
A discord (self)bot that splits a long amount of text and spams it in a channel that you choose. 

## How to Use
### Customising what to split
Open the `splittext.txt` and add your text. You can use the standard Discord markdown. The bot will only separate on new lines(sentences that go together should be on one line). The file is preloaded with the `Art of War - Sun Tzu`
### Running
Open `splitext.py` in a text editor and set token to your/a bot token and then set sendto to the channel id in which you want to send the split text.

## WARNING
**THIS IS AGAINST DISCORD TOS IF YOU USE THIS AS A SELF BOT. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTION TAKEN BY DISCORD ON YOUR ACCOUNT FOR SELF-BOTTING**
